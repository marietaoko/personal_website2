            <p>Stories. For centuries, people have been telling and sharing them. They have now become almost essential to humankind. For most people, they are ways to escape, dream, think and reflect, discuss, learn, and more. This is why we are so interested in stories that are communicated to us through books, films, series, family… </p>

          <h2>Fairy Tales</h2>
        <div id="topic1">
          <p>From a very young age, we are told fairy tales, fables, legends, myths which aim to educate, inform, and bring awareness about issues that we often encounter in life.</p>
          <p>For example, we all know what happened to Little Red Riding Hood, the adventure of Hansel and Gretel, or the love story of Beauty and the Beast. Indeed, these stories, though first written centuries apart, are still told to us from childhood, and we are still passing them on to next generations. </p>
          <p>The primary goal of these stories is to educate; however, as they were written centuries ago, a lot of them are not appropriate to our world anymore. Thus, for a lot of children, these stories are just fairy tales whose only purpose is to entertain because of how difficult it is to identify to them.</p>

         <p>In this 21st century society we live in, with all the visual content that are brought to children at the cinema, on television, or in video games, their vision has changed. A talking wolf approaching a young girl in the woods is more magical than scary, and a house of candy hidden in a magical forest is closer to a dream than a trap. I believe that telling these stories from a more contemporary approach and setting them in a more familiar environment would make them more relatable ant their purpose would work more efficiently.
      </p>
       </div>
         <div id="topic1">
         <p>Also, today, we realize that the morals behind some of these stories are sometimes misplaced which leads to the normalization of real and serious issues. For example, the tale of Beauty and the Beast which romanticizes the Stockholm syndrome comes to mind. I think that exposing the problems that are not put forward and even ignored in these stories could transform them into completely different ones with completely different outcomes that could be more appropriate to today’s world and society. </p>

        <h2>Proposal</h2>
        <p>For my final project, I want to design a narrative and interactive website that revisits some of the famous fairy tales of our childhood and will allow people to rewrite these tales in an unconventional way.</p>
    
        <p> My goal is to have the user choose between at least 3 fairy tales. Then, the famous tale will be written with illustrations or photographs as if it was happening in our 21st century western world. At each step of the story, the user will be able to select a way for the character to act among multiple choices questions which will lead to a different story outcome.  
        </p>
    
        <p> I would like my website to be inclusive and thus designed for every one of every age, gender, race, social class… However, I know that, as a lot of Disney movies for example, the website will mean different things to different generations. I hope for it to have educational purpose on children, to provide self-reflection to teenagers, and to allow adults to re-visit their old childhood tales and maybe even realize some messages or inconsistencies. I want the website to be as easy to brows as possible for everyone to be able to use it. Also, even if it is a rather serious subject, I would like to bring humour to it through the multiple choices’ questions. </p>
