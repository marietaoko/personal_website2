      <h2>Why?</h2>
    <div id="topic4">
      <p>I chose these three fairy tales because as they were often told to me as a child, I feel close to them. Plus, they are well known all over the world. Thus, I thought it would be interesting to work on them for this project. Also, I find studying them very interesting. Indeed, I remember being so lost because Little Red Riding Hood had different endings, going from happy to terrifying, depending on who was telling the story.</p>
      <p>I remember thinking how horrible it was that the parents of Hansel and Gretel abandoned them in the forest because they didn’t have enough food. I remember realizing that Belle and the Beast ending together was the pure result of Stockholm syndrome. All these stories have awful aspects, but since they are set in a magical world, people and especially children are not disturbed by them. This is why I think children would be more sensible to them if they were set in a more familiar environment.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in these three stories, the “villain” always looks like one. Whether it is the wolf, the witch, or the beast, these three characters are already well known as representations of something dangerous and to fear. However, in real life, dangerous people often look like polite, nice, normal human beings which is one of the things I want to put forward in my versions of these fairy tales. </p>

    <h2>Little Red Riding Hood, Charles Perrault</h2>
    <p>Little Red Riding Hood is about a pretty young girl who, on the path to her grandmother’s, came across a wolf whose intention was to eat her. However, as there were woodcutters not far, he couldn’t eat her in those woods. Consequently, after asking to the Little Red Riding Hood where she was going, he got there first and ate her grandmother. Later, when the young girl arrived, he pretended to be her grandmother to entice her into the house and ate her as well. </p>

    <p> The moral of this story is to not talk to strangers. The lesson to learn is that anyone you encounter can be dangerous, and that everyone should be careful.

    <h2>Hansel and Gretel, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm</h2>
    <p>The tale of Hansel and Gretel is about two siblings whose parents abandoned in the woods because they didn’t have enough food for them. After a few days walking in the endless forest, they found a house of gingerbread and candy in which a witch was living. After capturing the children, her plan was to eat them. However, the children were able to kill the witch by burning her and escape with her precious belongings. When they return home, their mother (who was the one who had the idea to abandon them in the first place) was dead, and their father was very happy to see them. Thanks to the expansive objects Hansel and Gretel brought back from the witch’s house, the family no longer lacked anything.</p>

    <p> The moral of the tale of Hansel and Gretel is to not trust strangers, even the ones who seem nice and welcoming. Some people can seem as if they could save your life, but they can be real monsters inside.</p>

    <h2>Beauty and the Beast, Walt Disney movie</h2>
    <p>In the famous story of Beauty and the Beast, a beautiful young woman, Belle, discovers a castle hidden in a forest. Inside lives a Beast who kidnaps and exploits her. As Belle spends time in the castle and with the Beast, she starts to realize that he is not as mean as he seems and falls in love with him. After kissing each other, the Beast returns to his original form which is the one of a prince who had received a curse from a witch a long time ago. Belle and the Prince end up marrying each other and lived happily ever after.</p>

    <p> The moral of this fairy tale is to not judge on appearances which is a very important lesson to learn from a very young age. However, when you observe the story from a different point of view, Belle falling in love with the Beast is a clear representation of the Stockholm syndrome.</p>
