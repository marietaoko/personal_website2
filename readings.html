                       <h6>As We May Think (reflection):</h6>
                       <p>In As We May Think, Vannevar Bush addresses the application of science to inventions that reproduce, replace, improve humans’ minds and knowledge rather than focusing on increasing their physical powers. 
                        For a long time, scientists such as physicists or engineers used their knowledge to find ways to better people’s lives and material environments by designing and creating devices, mechanisms, gadgets that would reproduce our physical abilities sometimes at a much higher level to help us in our daily lives. However, after World War II, Bush reflected on how would our lives be improved if we could use these technologies to the conception of devices that would store people’s knowledge? </p>
                        
                        <p>The human mind works in a very particular way. The chain of thoughts in our brain works with association. An idea leads to another depending on their similarities transmitted extremely rapidly via brain cells, an operation that is especially difficult to reproduce technologically. Accordingly, in 1945, to express his idea, Bush introduced a theoretical, futuristic invention: memex. 
                        The goal of this device was to collect a great number of memories, records, “books”, just like a library. This storage of knowledge in what Bush imagined as a “desk” would work with association at a significant speed and fluidity similar to the human brain.</p>
                        
                        <p>For his hypothetical creation, Bush was inspired by the already known bodily mechanisms. Personally, I have always been interested in the human body and bodily functions and in finding inspiration in it which is why I find Bush’s idea so interesting. Finding his inspiration in how our brain functions was very smart. I think that he was well ahead of his time regarding the storage of knowledge in an object.  
                        Moreover, as Bush mentions it, the human brain isn’t perfect. If certain brain cells are not stimulated and used enough, the memory linked to this trail might vanish. I believe that storing our knowledge into a device such as memex would have avoided that while accumulating even more knowledge that our brain can. Thinking of such a machine that would exceed our human brain’s limitations in 1945 was impressing.</p>

                       <h6>Virtual Revolution: The great Levelling (reflection):</h6>
                       <p>In Virtual Revolution – The great Levelling, Dr. Aleks Krotoski introduces the history of the internet and the world wide web, and their actions and repercussions on our lives, our world, our society. </p>
                       <p>As presented in the documentary, the internet which began in the second half of the 20th century was a virtual revolution. It was an empowering tool for all, a way to have access to knowledge, a way for “ordinary people to create something extraordinary”, a way to shake knowledge together. The internet is described as a great “legacy of counterculture”, that can encapsulate peoples’ values, fights, demonstrations, idealisms… It is a way for people to fight real life struggles online, struggles that then take whole new dimensions. The internet revolutionized communication and the storing of knowledge and as figures such as John Barlow mentions it, the internet became a challenge to traditional authority. Indeed, it was a free place for self-expression that had no boundaries, people became able to express themselves, their ideas, their voices. </p>
                       <p>It is in 1989 that Tim Burners-Lee made his first proposal of what he call “Information Management” that soon became the World Wide Web, and in 1991, the first website was posted online. This created a whole new line of information for all people with a computer. Figures like Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak explained their relation to the internet and the web and expressed how it quickly became a vast business. People were able to share information with everyone all around the world, being connected empowered people who could learn and find everything online on their own. It allowed everyone to publish whatever they wanted in any format with no controlling authority. Thus, quickly arrived illegal sharing of information, music, videos. Today everyone can access so many sources thanks to YouTube or Social Medias such as Facebook. People can upload whatever they want.</p>
                       <p>Personally, I believe that the internet and the web are great inventions that greatly better and facilitate our lives. We can now find so much information so easily which makes learning and communication faster and more effective. Nowadays, a lot of people, companies, organizations use the web daily. It is a platform so practical and instinctive that even young children learn to use it very quickly and easily. 
                        I think that the main danger and issue of the internet is how some people use it. Examples of cyber bullying or raising hate come to mind. Freedom of speech and the fact that the internet is almost uncontrollable have allowed people to post all sorts of hurtful ideas. Even though I am for freedom and being able to express ourselves to a certain point, I believe that the internet can be dangerous because as it is said in the documentary, everyone can use it and share everything with no restrictions. 
                        That said, I still believe that the web is a great part of our lives now and that it has improved our ways of working, communicating, advertising, entertaining, and more

            <h3>The Social Dilemma</h3>

                       <h6>The Social Dilemma (reflection):</h6>
                       <p>The Social Dilemma is a documentary focused on social media – their process and their consequences on us as individuals and on our society.<br/>
                        In this documentary, different engineers, doctors, entrepreneurs, scientists, ethicists… are presenting their views on social media as people who have studied these companies, and/or worked with them. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>As Tristan Harris mentions it, there are real, clear, unknown, and worrying problems in the tech industry regarding these new ways of social exchange and communication.<br/>
                        He shows how these platforms are not “tools”. They come to find you, not the other way around. We shifted from a “tools-based technology environment to an addiction and manipulation-based technology environment” (Tristan Harris). We now live in a world in which advertisers are the customers and people are the product. “If you’re not paying for the product than you are the product”.</p>
                        
                        <p>Consequently, it is important to understand the goals of these platforms. Their aim is to keep people on screen and interested. Using notifications, tagging, endless information, social media are creating a need for people to navigate them. As Tristan Harris says, social media is understanding the minds of people without us realizing it like a magician’s work. It is “exploring vulnerability in human psychology” (Sean Parker). As Dr Anna Lembke mentions it, social media is a drug, it makes us feel close to people which releases dopamine. Consequently, we got to a point where people don’t know how to act or live without their phones and lose time on them. </p>

                        <p>Furthermore, the documentary shows how social media have an unimaginable impact on our minds and emotions. In too much cases they lead to depression, anxiety, shame especially for younger people who are developing and don’t know how to handle it. As Jonathan Haidt presents it, this generated an increasing amount of people and especially young girls hurting or killing themselves since the beginning of the century. We are built for knowing what our surrounding thinks of us, but not for knowing what 10 000 people think of us which is an idea that I find very true. I think that this is why so many people stop social media at some point. The amount of judgement on these platforms can be overwhelming. </p>

                        <p>Personally, I find this documentary very interesting. I have seen the seriousness of the consequences of social media especially towards a younger audience. It expresses the difficulty that we have to function without our phones. This addiction people have is increasing every day and I think that we should think of ways to get out of it. In the documentary, I found the mention of people behind the social media and the great impact they have on our lives very interesting. I thought that the comparison to the magicians was a great analogy since it feels like we are losing control of what we see and thus believe. <br/>
                        That said, I think that social media are not necessarily as bad as expressed in the documentary. I believe that they have a certain utility and are a good way to connect and exchange with people. I think what is important is finding the boundary, being careful of the content (such as fake news), being able to separate the real from the fake and the true from the false. It is essential to learn not to lose ourselves in these platforms. I think that we can get to a point with more awareness on the subject, so social media won’t be as much a problem as depicted in The Social Dilemma.</p>
