                       <h6>As We May Think (reflection):</h6>
                       <p>In As We May Think, Vannevar Bush addresses the application of science to inventions that reproduce, replace, improve humans’ minds and knowledge rather than focusing on increasing their physical powers. 
                        For a long time, scientists such as physicists or engineers used their knowledge to find ways to better people’s lives and material environments by designing and creating devices, mechanisms, gadgets that would reproduce our physical abilities sometimes at a much higher level to help us in our daily lives. However, after World War II, Bush reflected on how would our lives be improved if we could use these technologies to the conception of devices that would store people’s knowledge? </p>
                        
                        <p>The human mind works in a very particular way. The chain of thoughts in our brain works with association. An idea leads to another depending on their similarities transmitted extremely rapidly via brain cells, an operation that is especially difficult to reproduce technologically. Accordingly, in 1945, to express his idea, Bush introduced a theoretical, futuristic invention: memex. 
                        The goal of this device was to collect a great number of memories, records, “books”, just like a library. This storage of knowledge in what Bush imagined as a “desk” would work with association at a significant speed and fluidity similar to the human brain.</p>
                        
                        <p>For his hypothetical creation, Bush was inspired by the already known bodily mechanisms. Personally, I have always been interested in the human body and bodily functions and in finding inspiration in it which is why I find Bush’s idea so interesting. Finding his inspiration in how our brain functions was very smart. I think that he was well ahead of his time regarding the storage of knowledge in an object.  
                        Moreover, as Bush mentions it, the human brain isn’t perfect. If certain brain cells are not stimulated and used enough, the memory linked to this trail might vanish. I believe that storing our knowledge into a device such as memex would have avoided that while accumulating even more knowledge that our brain can. Thinking of such a machine that would exceed our human brain’s limitations in 1945 was impressing.</p>

                       <h6>Virtual Revolution: The great Levelling (reflection):</h6>
                       <p>In Virtual Revolution – The great Levelling, Dr. Aleks Krotoski introduces the history of the internet and the world wide web, and their actions and repercussions on our lives, our world, our society. </p>
                       <p>As presented in the documentary, the internet which began in the second half of the 20th century was a virtual revolution. It was an empowering tool for all, a way to have access to knowledge, a way for “ordinary people to create something extraordinary”, a way to shake knowledge together. The internet is described as a great “legacy of counterculture”, that can encapsulate peoples’ values, fights, demonstrations, idealisms… It is a way for people to fight real life struggles online, struggles that then take whole new dimensions. The internet revolutionized communication and the storing of knowledge and as figures such as John Barlow mentions it, the internet became a challenge to traditional authority. Indeed, it was a free place for self-expression that had no boundaries, people became able to express themselves, their ideas, their voices. </p>
                       <p>It is in 1989 that Tim Burners-Lee made his first proposal of what he call “Information Management” that soon became the World Wide Web, and in 1991, the first website was posted online. This created a whole new line of information for all people with a computer. Figures like Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak explained their relation to the internet and the web and expressed how it quickly became a vast business. People were able to share information with everyone all around the world, being connected empowered people who could learn and find everything online on their own. It allowed everyone to publish whatever they wanted in any format with no controlling authority. Thus, quickly arrived illegal sharing of information, music, videos. Today everyone can access so many sources thanks to YouTube or Social Medias such as Facebook. People can upload whatever they want.</p>
                       <p>Personally, I believe that the internet and the web are great inventions that greatly better and facilitate our lives. We can now find so much information so easily which makes learning and communication faster and more effective. Nowadays, a lot of people, companies, organizations use the web daily. It is a platform so practical and instinctive that even young children learn to use it very quickly and easily. 
                        I think that the main danger and issue of the internet is how some people use it. Examples of cyber bullying or raising hate come to mind. Freedom of speech and the fact that the internet is almost uncontrollable have allowed people to post all sorts of hurtful ideas. Even though I am for freedom and being able to express ourselves to a certain point, I believe that the internet can be dangerous because as it is said in the documentary, everyone can use it and share everything with no restrictions. 
                        That said, I still believe that the web is a great part of our lives now and that it has improved our ways of working, communicating, advertising, entertaining, and more

            <h3>The Social Dilemma</h3>

                       <h6>The Social Dilemma (reflection):</h6>
                       <p>The Social Dilemma is a documentary focused on social media – their process and their consequences on us as individuals and on our society.<br/>
                        In this documentary, different engineers, doctors, entrepreneurs, scientists, ethicists… are presenting their views on social media as people who have studied these companies, and/or worked with them. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>As Tristan Harris mentions it, there are real, clear, unknown, and worrying problems in the tech industry regarding these new ways of social exchange and communication.<br/>
                        He shows how these platforms are not “tools”. They come to find you, not the other way around. We shifted from a “tools-based technology environment to an addiction and manipulation-based technology environment” (Tristan Harris). We now live in a world in which advertisers are the customers and people are the product. “If you’re not paying for the product than you are the product”.</p>
                        
                        <p>Consequently, it is important to understand the goals of these platforms. Their aim is to keep people on screen and interested. Using notifications, tagging, endless information, social media are creating a need for people to navigate them. As Tristan Harris says, social media is understanding the minds of people without us realizing it like a magician’s work. It is “exploring vulnerability in human psychology” (Sean Parker). As Dr Anna Lembke mentions it, social media is a drug, it makes us feel close to people which releases dopamine. Consequently, we got to a point where people don’t know how to act or live without their phones and lose time on them. </p>

                        <p>Furthermore, the documentary shows how social media have an unimaginable impact on our minds and emotions. In too much cases they lead to depression, anxiety, shame especially for younger people who are developing and don’t know how to handle it. As Jonathan Haidt presents it, this generated an increasing amount of people and especially young girls hurting or killing themselves since the beginning of the century. We are built for knowing what our surrounding thinks of us, but not for knowing what 10 000 people think of us which is an idea that I find very true. I think that this is why so many people stop social media at some point. The amount of judgement on these platforms can be overwhelming. </p>

                        <p>Personally, I find this documentary very interesting. I have seen the seriousness of the consequences of social media especially towards a younger audience. It expresses the difficulty that we have to function without our phones. This addiction people have is increasing every day and I think that we should think of ways to get out of it. In the documentary, I found the mention of people behind the social media and the great impact they have on our lives very interesting. I thought that the comparison to the magicians was a great analogy since it feels like we are losing control of what we see and thus believe. <br/>
                        That said, I think that social media are not necessarily as bad as expressed in the documentary. I believe that they have a certain utility and are a good way to connect and exchange with people. I think what is important is finding the boundary, being careful of the content (such as fake news), being able to separate the real from the fake and the true from the false. It is essential to learn not to lose ourselves in these platforms. I think that we can get to a point with more awareness on the subject, so social media won’t be as much a problem as depicted in The Social Dilemma.</p>

                       <h6>“Thank You, Black Twitter”: State Violence, Digital Counterpublics, and Pedagogies of Resistance (reflection):</h6>
                       <p>In this world that we are living in, discrimination, racism, and violence against black people whether physical, verbal, psychological and more, have always been a serious issue. This matter is particularly spread and have extremely severe consequences in the United-States. ““Thank You, Black Twitter”: State Violence, Digital Counterpublics, and Pedagogies of Resistance”, is an article written by Marc Lamont Hill’ that analyzes the role and outcome of Black Twitter as a ‘digital counterpublic’.</p>
                       <p>Black Twitter is a virtual gathering on Twitter of people taking part in real-life discourses on Black American culture and politics. Thus, this place on Twitter has become a digital counterpublic in the sense that mainly black people are freely able to resist and critic hegemonic power, to negotiate oppositional identities; essentially, to meet and have a voice on how black people are being treated, discriminated, watched, hurt, killed, put aside especially in the US. It has become a form of resistance against anti-black state violence.</p>
                       <p>Thanks, to Black Twitter, the extremely violent actions initiated by the state, police force, and more are not being shut down or unspoken as easily anymore. Platforms such as social media have this advantage of spreading information faster than ever in the world’s history. Plus, everyone can share their feelings and reactions on the subject, it is not led by the media and thus the state. We can now see the severity of these actions on pictures, videos, texts through social media. Thanks to the visibility of Black Twitter, people of power are little by little restraining the violence against black people which is why Marc Lamont Hill’ calls it the “new surveillances”. However, the hatred is still there, and the violence is still far too present.</p>
                       <p>Even though, sometimes, the content found on Black Twitter is questionable, I think that it allows black people to feel listen to, to feel part of a community that understand them, to not feel completely invisible like a big part of society make them feel every day. The fact that this information is being spread on social media which are related to smartphones allows the youth to be educated on the subject whether they are people of color or not. I believe that it is so important for everyone to be aware of the consequences of discrimination and that everyone sees the humanity behind every black people who have been mistreated, assaulted, or killed. Plus, I find that it is very sadly important that young people of color are prepared and aware of our world situation. <br>
                        In my opinion, one of the greatest dangers of anti-black violence is its invisibility. The unspoken, the hidden information, the lack of awareness.
                        </p>
                        <p>I found that mentioning #SayHerName and displaying how black women/girls are being treated by our society very interesting and important in this article. I believe that it is a subject that is not spoken of enough for how discriminated this population is. The situation of black women/girls is directly linked to anti-black violence and sexism which is why the mention of this issue on Black Twitter is so important. It reaches so many people and can make things happen even if it is through small steps.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, social media is a place with almost total freedom which is why the statements found on them can be hurtful or even dangerous and raise hatred. However, I believe that Black Twitter does a great job in raising awareness and creating an online community where black people can be heard. Something that is not always possible in the everyday life. </p>

                       <h6>Everything is a Remix Remastered (reflection):</h6>
                       <p>Creation requires influence. This is the concept that the documentary “Everything is a Remix Remastered” is expressing. This video shows how creativity always comes from somewhere and how for centuries, people have been getting inspiration and using past creations and discoveries to get to something new in the arts but also in other fields such as science.</p>
                        
                        <p>As it is said in the documentary, Remixing is transforming the old into the new. Everything we make such as books, movies, music, is a remix of something. Creativity comes from copying and goes to transforming, to combining. We need copying to build the foundation of knowledge and understanding, then we transform this foundation, and the combination of all these ideas leads to the biggest breakthroughs. Evolution works the same way. <br/>
                            Sometimes, multiple discoveries, which are discoveries happening at the same time, occur. Indeed, sometimes, people get to the same new ideas, create the same new concepts at the same time. This has happened in music, cinema, books, scientific inventions and more.</p>
                        
                        <p>Personally, I believe that remixing is a good and necessary thing that often leads to innovation. I don’t think that remixing should go as far as using someone else’s idea and changing 10% to make it our own, but using these ideas as a starting point, as inspiration can lead to incredible things. Even in my own work, I often find inspiration in other artists, other designers, and even other fields such as science. Combining these inspirations lead me to my own concept that I then develop and transform with my techniques and my values to make it my own.<br/>
                            Even in my own work, I often find inspiration in other artists, other designers, and even other fields such as science. Combining these inspirations lead me to my own concept that I then develop and transform with my techniques and my values to make it my own. <br/> Of course, we have seen a lot of examples of remix that have been more popular than the original idea which I think is a shame for the people who came up with the idea. However, in my opinion, we can think of that as some sort of a “cooperative work”. The “original” idea was probably also inspired of something else, which was probably inspired of something else and so on. Consequently, over decades, ideas grew again and again with each people remixing them to get to what they are now and will be in the future. 
                            I want to believe in the fact that new things are yet to be created, I want to believe that innovation is still possible, and I think that remixing is a path to that.
                            
                        </p>

                        <p>In conclusion, I feel that it is important to find the limit not to exceed to the remix; however, when this line is respected, remixing can lead to great things and to the innovation of our world.  </p>
