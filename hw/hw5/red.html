        <!-- <p id="red1">Once upon our time, in the North of Solina city, lived a young girl. She was always very kind and helpful to others. Almost every day, the girl wore a red hoodie, which, in the neighbourhood, gave her the nickname of Little Red Hoodie. She lived in a small house at the west of the district with her parents, but she loved visiting her grandmother who was living on the other side of the neighbourhood. </p> -->

        <p id="red2">One day, after school, the Little Red Hoodie decided to go visit her grandmother to bring her some cookies that she had backed the night before. She loved walking there; it was only a 10 minutes’ walk, and it was an opportunity to walk in the streets of the city with all the stores, the cafés, the restaurants. </p>

            <p id="red3">When the Little Red Hoodie went out that night, the sun was setting, and everyone started to go home, so there wasn’t as many people in the streets as usual. When she passed her favorite coffee shop, the Little Red Hoodie was approached by a middle-aged man saying that it was dangerous to walk alone in the streets at this time. He asked her if he could accompany her wherever she was going.</p>
