   <div class="title">Stories. For centuries, people have been telling and sharing them. They have now become almost essential to humankind. For most people, they are ways to escape, dream, think and reflect, discuss, learn, and more. This is why we are so interested in stories that are communicated to us through books, films, series, family… From a very young age, we are told fairy tales, fables, legends, myths which aim to educate, inform, and bring awareness about issues that we often encounter in life. <br>
    For my final project, I wanted to design a narrative and interactive website that revisits some of the famous fairy tales of our childhood and will allow people to rewrite these tales in an unconventional way. <br> My goal was to have the user choose a fairy tale and rewrite it with multiple choice questions as if it was happening in our 21st century western world. At each step of the story, the user is able to select a way for the character to act which leads to a different story outcome. <br> I wanted my website to be inclusive and thus designed for every one of every age, gender, race, social class… However, I know that, as a lot of Disney movies for example, the website will mean different things to different generations. I wanted it to have educational purpose on children, to provide self-reflection to teenagers, and to allow adults to re-visit their old childhood tales and maybe even realize some messages or inconsistencies. </div>
